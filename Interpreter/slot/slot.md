# example

    class A(object):
        __slots__ = ["wing", "leg"]

        x = 3


what's the difference of accessing attribute `wing` and `x` of instance `a` ?

what's the difference of accessing attribute `wing` and `x` of type `A` ?

# instance access

## instance access wing

### before set a value

	>>> a = A()
    >>> a.wing
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: wing

according to the **attribute accessing procedure** described in [descr](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/Interpreter/descr/descr.md)

we can draw the procedure of accessing `a.wing` in  a brief view

![instance_desc](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/Interpreter/slot/instance_desc.png)

the **descriptor protocol** help us find an object named `descr`, type is `member_descriptor`, if you call

	repr(descr)
    descr: <member 'wing' of 'A' objects>

the `descr` has a member named `d_member`, which stores information about the attribute name, type and offset

with the informations stored in `d_member`, you are able to access the address of attribute in a very fast way

in the current example, if the begin address of the instance `a` is `0x00`, address after adding the offset is `0x18`, you can cast the address in `0x18` to a proper object according to `type` stored in `d_member`

	/* Include/structmember.h */
    #define T_OBJECT_EX 16  /* Like T_OBJECT, but raises AttributeError
                               when the value is NULL, instead of
                               converting to None. */

	/* Python/structmember.c */
    addr += l->offset;
    switch (l->type) {
    	/* ... */
        case T_OBJECT_EX:
            v = *(PyObject **)addr;
            /* because wing attribute of instance a is never set,
            it raise an attribute error */
            if (v == NULL)
                PyErr_SetString(PyExc_AttributeError, l->name);
            Py_XINCREF(v);
            break;
        /* ... */
    }

![offset](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/Interpreter/slot/offset.png)

### after set a value

	>>> a = A()
    >>> a.wing = "wingA"
    >>> a.wing
    'wingA'

because wing attribute of instance `a` is set before, `AttributeError` won't be raised

## instance access x

	>>> a.x
	>>> 3

type of `descr` is `int`, it's not a data descriptor(does not have `__get__` or `__set__` attribute), so the `descr` will be returned directly

![instance_normal](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/Interpreter/slot/instance_normal.png)

you are not able to create any other attribute in instance `a` if `A` defined `__slots__`, we will figure out why later

	>>> a.not_exist = 100
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
	AttributeError: 'A' object has no attribute 'not_exist'

# access type

## type access wing

	>>> A.wing
	<member 'wing' of 'A' objects>
    >>> type(A.wing)
    <class 'member_descriptor'>

the procedure of accessing `A.wing` is nearly the same as `a.wing`

![type_desc](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/Interpreter/slot/type_desc.png)

## type access x

	>>> A.x
	3

the procedure of accessing `A.x` is nearly the same as `a.x`

![type_normal](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/Interpreter/slot/type_normal.png)

# difference

## with slot

### how does attributes initialized in the creation of `class A` ?

we can laern about the creation procedure in [type->creation of class](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/BasicObject/type/type.md#creation-of-class)

`type` object has many fields in it's C structure, the following picture only shows what's necessary for this topic

what's in the `__slots__` is sorted and stored as a tuple in `ht_slots`

the two attributes in `__slots__` is preallocated in the tail of the newly created type object `A` and two `PyMemberDef` pointers are stored in the order of `ht_slots`

while attribute `x` stays in the `tp_dict` field

the `tp_dict` field does not have a key named `__dict__`

![type_create](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/Interpreter/slot/type_create.png)

### how does attributes initialized in the creation of `instance a` ?

the memory location of the attributes in `__slots__` are preallocated

![instance_create](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/Interpreter/slot/instance_create.png)

### lookup procedure in MRO ?

it just iter through every type object in MRO, and if the name in `__dict__` attribute, retuen `__dict__[name]`

	/* cpython/Objects/typeobject.c */
    /* for the instance a, if we access a.wing
       type: <class '__main__.A'>
       mro: (<class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
       name: 'wing'
    */
	mro = type->tp_mro;
    n = PyTuple_GET_SIZE(mro);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        base = PyTuple_GET_ITEM(mro, i);
        dict = ((PyTypeObject *)base)->tp_dict;
        // in python representation: res = dict[name]
        res = _PyDict_GetItem_KnownHash(dict, name, hash);
        if (res != NULL)
            break;
        if (PyErr_Occurred()) {
            *error = -1;
            goto done;
        }
    }

if we try to access attribute `wing`

	>>> type(A.wing)
	<class 'member_descriptor'>
	>>> type(a).__mro__
	(<class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
    >>> print(a.wing)
    wingA

the following pseudo shows what's going on

	res = None
    for each_type in type(a).__mro__
    	if "wing" each_type.__dict__:
        	res = each_type.__dict__["wing"]
            break
    # do the attribute accessing procedure described in the other article
    ...
    if res is a data_descriptor:
    	# res is A.wing, it's type is member_descriptor
        # it stores the offset and some other information of the real object stored in instance
        # member_descriptor.__get__ will find the address in a + offset, and cast it to a PyObject and return that object
    	return res.__get__(a, type(a))
    ...

## without slot

    class A(object):

        x = 3
        wing = "wingA"
        leg = "legA"

### how does attributes initialized in the creation of `class A` ?

the `tp_dict` field has a key named `__dict__`
